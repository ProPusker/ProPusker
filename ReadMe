 💫 About Me

Hi — I'm ProPusker 👋

I design and build reliable cloud platforms, automation, and operational tooling. My work is focused on AWS automation, infrastructure reliability, and practical scripts that save time and reduce risk — mostly authored in PowerShell and Python.

At a glance
- Current: Senior Cloud Engineer — platform architecture, IaC, automation, observability, and incident response.
- Former: IT Director, System Engineer, Admin — hands-on with servers, AD, M365, and day-to-day ops.
- Languages & tools: PowerShell • Python • Bash • AWS • Lambda • RDS • S3 • CloudTrail • Terraform / IaC workflows • GitHub Actions

What I build
- AWS disaster recovery and validation scripts (RDS PITR, Multi-AZ failover)  
  Example: [AWS-RDS-Disaster-Recovery](https://github.com/ProPusker/AWS-RDS-Disaster-Recovery) — README & configuration updates (commit: "Add README for AWS RDS Disaster Recovery Script", 2026-01-20)
- Network & packet capture tooling for ALBs and traffic analysis  
  [AWS-PacketCapture](https://github.com/ProPusker/AWS-PacketCapture)
- AWS inventory & unused resource auditing to cut cost and improve security  
  [AWS-Unused-Resources](https://github.com/ProPusker/AWS-Unused-Resources)
- CloudTrail analysis for EC2 & service events  
  [ec2-cloudtrail-logsearch](https://github.com/ProPusker/ec2-cloudtrail-logsearch)
- KMS rotation/audit automation and small Lambda security tooling  
  [AWS-KMS-Audit](https://github.com/ProPusker/AWS-KMS-Audit), [AWS-Lamda-SSLMonitor](https://github.com/ProPusker/AWS-Lamda-SSLMonitor)
- Microsoft 365 & Active Directory automation (group exports, license reports)  
  [M365ImportGroups.ps1](https://github.com/ProPusker/M365ImportGroups.ps1), [M365UserLicense.ps1](https://github.com/ProPusker/M365UserLicense.ps1)
- Windows monitoring, file cleanup and maintenance utilities  
  [WindowsMonitor](https://github.com/ProPusker/WindowsMonitor), [FileCleanup](https://github.com/ProPusker/FileCleanup)

Most of my practical work is focused on automating common operational tasks and enabling safer, repeatable changes.
